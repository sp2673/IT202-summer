Static changes like hard-coded colors/values will not count at all (i.e., changing shapes/colors/values that are globally defined and set only once). You may however change such values through game logic during runtime.

<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>so I chose to do collect the square game and the first thing<br>I choose to modify was overtime the cube collides with the target the<br>red cube gets bigger by a certain size. the second thing I modified<br>was after you score 10 points the game ends on its own and<br>it gives you a confirm message if you want to relent the page<br>and after you hit ok it brings you back to the start page.<br></p><br></td></tr>

<tr><td><table><tr><td> <em>Sub-Task 1: </em> Talk about what you learned during this assignment and the related HTML5 Canvas readings (at least a few sentences for full credit)</td></tr>
<tr><td> <em>Response:</em> <p>while making this game I learned a lot which was to how to<br>dissect the code and see what each line does. this was the first<br>time we were doing something by our own so I was little challenging<br>but in the end it was satisfying. I learned how to end game<br>when it reaches certain score. I learned about how to show a message<br>on the screen. I learned how to refresh the page without doing it<br>physically from the url. I learned how to make object bigger when it<br>collides with something.<br></p><br></td></tr>
